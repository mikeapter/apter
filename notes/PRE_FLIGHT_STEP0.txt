STEP 0 - Pre-flight sign-off 
 
Repo root confirmed: C:\Users\Michael\Desktop\BotTrader Files\BotTrader\BotTrader 
Must contain: App/ Core/ Config/ scripts/ 
 
WHAT I WILL NOT CHANGE (trading logic): 
- Core/ (risk, execution, alpha, throttles, guards) 
- Strategies/ 
- Trading behavior configs (IPS, blackouts, risk limits) 
 
WHAT I WILL CHANGE/ADD ONLY (website/control plane): 
- Platform/ (FastAPI control plane + Next.js UI) 
- scripts/ wrappers for start/stop/log streaming ONLY 
 
Rule: UI never trades directly. UI calls API. API commands runtime.
